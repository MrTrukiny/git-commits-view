# Welcome to _Git Commits View_ app

This is a tiny application that shows latest commits made into my repo _git-commits-view_ by fetching
them all directly from **GitHub API**. Future versions could search for any public repo. Private repos would require authentication tokens.

This was made using **React**, **Typescript** and **styled-components**. If you want to run it into your machine, make sure to have **Node (^14.16.1)** installed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### You can see a deployed version accesing here: [Git Commits View](https://git-commits-view.netlify.app/).
